The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) 
is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as 
a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on)
 think of the information they store as a set of files
 and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).

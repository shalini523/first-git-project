Distributed Version Control System: Git has a remote repository 
which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored 
in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not 
just stored in a central server, 
but the full copy of the code is present in all the developers' computers.
it is very good application.
it is very difficult strutue.
